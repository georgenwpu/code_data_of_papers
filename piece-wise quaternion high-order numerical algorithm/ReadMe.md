# The simulation data of PWQHN(piece-wise quaternion high-order numerical) algorithm

## Introduction
These are the simulation data of the paper _A Super-high-accuracy Attitude Measurement Method of SINS based on PWQHN Algorithm in the High-dynamic Maneuver Environment_. Each .mat file contains two matrix _wm_ and _qr_. _wm_ is the angular increment vector series and _qr_ is the reference attitude quaternion of simulation. The 1st~3rd column are angular increment that unit is rad and the 4 column is sampling time.
